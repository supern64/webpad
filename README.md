# WebPad Server

WebPad is a program for controlling your computer via other devices to perform certain actions.  
Define your commands in commands.js, and start writing anything!  
Client at [http://webpadclient.glitch.me](http://webpadclient.glitch.me).  
The client source code will be included here as well in the client folder.  

## Setting it up

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm start`. Go to the client link (or open the file up on your browser) and connect to the server. After that, you'll be able to see the actions you've set up in your code and use them as well. Currently there is no complete documentation for writing commands and setting it up, but I may make one!
