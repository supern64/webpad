# WebPad Server

WebPad is a program for controlling your computer via other devices to perform certain actions.  
Define your commands in commands.js, and start writing!  
Client at [http://webpadclient.glitch.me](http://webpadclient.glitch.me).  
The client source code will be included here as well in the client folder.  
Note: This version is still not fully working, but it works enough so I would release it.

## Setting it up

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm start`. Go to the client link (or open it up on your browser) and connect to it. After that, you'll be able to see the actions you've set up in your code.
